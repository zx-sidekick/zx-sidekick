  Use whenever the user wants to catch up on or respond to GitHub issue or PR
  comments: "check the issues for new comments", "any comments to reply to?",
  "catch up on the tickets", or a board pass finding an unanswered comment.
  Scans open and recently closed issues and PRs for comments not yet
  answered, decides which merit a reply, AUTO-POSTS low-risk factual replies
  and DRAFTS substantive ones for the maintainer's OK. Every posted comment
  opens with the "🤖 Comment by Claude" attribution line. Trigger even if the
  user doesn't say "skill".

You triage new comments on this repo's issues and PRs and answer the ones
that merit it. Comments post under the maintainer's own account (@starquake)
through `gh`, so **every** reply opens with the attribution line, and a
public comment under someone else's name is hard to take back. Split replies
into *auto-post* (safe, factual) and *draft for approval* (substantive,
contestable). When unsure, it's a draft.

## The attribution line (never omit it)

Every comment you post starts with this exact line, then a blank line, then
the reply:

```
> 🤖 **Comment by Claude** (AI pair-programmer working with @starquake) — posted through @starquake's account.
```

Write the comment to a file and post with `gh issue comment <n> --body-file
<file>` (or `gh pr comment`): multi-line markdown with the `>` header breaks
`--body "…"` quoting.

## Step 1: find unanswered comments

Both the maintainer and Claude post as @starquake, so authorship can't tell
them apart; **the `> 🤖` prefix can**. A maintainer comment is a @starquake
comment that does NOT start with `> 🤖`.

1. List candidate threads (open, and touched in the last ~2 weeks):
   `gh issue list --state all --limit 40 --json number,title,updatedAt,state`
   and the same for `gh pr list`.
2. Pull each thread: `gh issue view <n> --json title,body,comments`.
3. **Unanswered** means a human comment (the maintainer's unmarked ones, or
   anyone else's) with no `> 🤖` comment after it. Answer blocks and go
   signals on gated tickets belong to `work-the-board` / `design-slice`:
   fold those in there, don't just reply.
4. Skip bot noise, and threads where a `> 🤖` reply already came last.

Report what you found before replying: "thread → unanswered comment".

## Step 2: which merit a reply

Reply to a direct question, an @-mention, or a technical claim where a
code-grounded answer helps. Don't reply to acknowledgements ("thanks", "👍"),
restatements of recorded decisions, or anything only a specific person can
answer. Silence is a fine outcome.

## Step 3: auto-post or draft

- **Auto-post**: factual and grounded. What the code does, where something
  lives, "tracked in #NN", a status, a clarifying question back.
- **Draft for approval**: opinion, pushback, anything that could read as a
  **decision** (decisions are the maintainer's), or anything you're not sure
  of. Show each draft with its thread, and post only the approved ones.

## Step 4: write it

Read the relevant code first, and never answer from memory. The answer goes in
the **first line**; reasoning goes below. Link the file, issue or PR you cite.

Example (auto-post, factual):

```
> 🤖 **Comment by Claude** (AI pair-programmer working with @starquake) — posted through @starquake's account.

No ROM is needed: the game enters the ROM at three addresses, and
`rom::answer` (`games/starquake/sidekick/src/rom.rs`) answers each one itself.
`sk-check rom` compares every such call against a real ROM, and
`games/starquake/docs/rom.md` records the evidence.
```

## Guardrails

- The attribution line goes on every posted comment, with no exceptions.
- Never post a design decision, only grounded observations.
- Never write in the maintainer's own voice.
- Don't double-reply. Prefer a few high-value replies over covering every
  thread.
